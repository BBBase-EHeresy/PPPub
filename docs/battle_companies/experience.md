So far we have only touched on what happens when the models in your Battle Company gain Experience, but we have not actually presented you with the various rules, charts, and anything else that they will require in order to progress and improve.

As stated previously, every time a model gains 5 Experience Points, they may roll on the relevant Progression chart (more on these later). These Experience Points are cumulative, so whenever a model in your Battle Company reaches a multiple of 5 Experience Points (5, 10, 15, etc.), they may roll on their Progression chart — even if they gained less than 5 in their previous game.

Warrior and Hero models work very differently when they progress. Warrior models roll on the chart below, whilst the progression for Hero models is explained over the next few pages.

Whenever a Warrior model gains enough Experience Points, they will roll on the Warrior Progression chart. This roll is not optional, and will happen whenever a Warrior has gained enough Experience. It represents the leaders of your company, or perhaps the lords they serve, rewarding the members of your company for their deeds on the battlefield and it would be considered bad form to refuse.

### WARRIOR PROGRESSION CHART

| D6  | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 1‑3 | No Effect — *Whilst the warrior's efforts have been valiant and noteworthy, they have not quite been enough to earn them a promotion in the eyes of their masters.* The Warrior does not gain a promotion. |
| 4‑5 | Promoted — *The warrior's actions over the company's adventures have been exceptional, and have not gone unnoticed.* The Warrior has been granted a promotion by the leader of the company, or the lord they serve, should they be able to receive one. Check the Advancements table on your Battle Company's page to see if they are eligible for a promotion, and if so, promote them to the new profile exchanging all wargear for the wargear of the new profile (any Equipment that was purchased can be carried over). If the Warrior is not eligible for a promotion, treat the result as No Effect instead. |
| 6   | A Hero in the Making — *The warrior's valorous deeds have resulted in the Warrior becoming a Hero in their own right.* From this point onwards, the Warrior is treated as a Hero and immediately gains 1 Fate point. They retain the Experience Points gained so far and will advance like a Hero from the next game on. |

Hero models, on the other hand, progress in a very different and much more varied way. This allows you to shape your Heroes into what you want them to be, and provides endless combinations and styles for you.

When a Hero progresses, they choose a certain path to follow, honing their skills in their chosen path to become an expert in their field. There are a total of eight different paths for a Hero to choose from, although some of them may only be chosen by Hero models that meet a certain criteria.

The first time a Hero gains 5 Experience Points, they may choose which path they will embark on, and then roll on the corresponding Progression chart. From this point forwards, the Hero may only roll on their chosen Progression chart, unless an Advancement, special rule or Scenario bonus allows them to do otherwise.

If a Hero rolls a result that they cannot take, either because they cannot improve their characteristics any further or they already have a special rule awarded, they may roll again on the same chart. Additionally, if a Hero rolls a special rule on their chosen path, they may choose to swap it for their Army Specific Hero Upgrade if they wish and don't already have
it.

In the unlikely event that a Hero earns enough Experience Points to roll on their path, and they cannot select any of the options (either due to the fact that all of their characteristics cannot be improved further, and they have every special rule listed), they may choose to embark on a second path.

### PATH OF THE WARRIOR
