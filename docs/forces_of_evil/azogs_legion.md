**OPTIONS**

- Signal Tower: 200 points
- The White Warg: 50 points
- Stone flail: 20 points
- [Heavy armour]: 10 points

- **Stone Flail (ACTIVE)**

The stone flail is a two-handed weapon that follows the normal rules for flails, with the following exceptions. When fighting with the stone flail, Azog’s Fight value is reduced to 6/5+. Azog does not reduce his Fight value for using the Whirl Special Strike. Additionally, Wounds inflicted by the stone flail cause not 1 Wound but D3 Wounds instead (determine the number of Wounds after Fate points are used), and any model that is struck, but not slain, is knocked Prone.

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Burly]
- **General of the North (ACTIVE)**

Azog’s Stand Fast! rule has a range of 12" and, unlike any other Hero model’s Stand Fast! rule, can affect other Orc Hero models.

- **I am the Master (ACTIVE)**

When rolling To Wound an enemy Hero model after winning a Fight, Azog never needs to roll more than a 3+ to score a wound, regardless of their Defence.

---

**SIGNAL TOWER**

The Signal Tower consists of four major parts:

- The Banner of Dol Guldur – The largest and most imposing banner upon the tower.
- The Banner of Gundabad – The two-pronged banner located to the right of the tower.
- The Banner of Angmar – The central stationary banner. 
- The Horn of Gorgoroth – The giant horn. 

The Signal Tower also comes with seven of Azog’s Lieutenants, armed with swords, to man the tower. These Lieutenants do not count as part of Azog’s warband and may not lead troops.

**AZOG'S LIEUTENANTS**

*ORC, GUNDABAD, INFANTRY, HERO*

| Mv | F | S | D | A | W | C | M | W | F |
|:--:|:--:|:-:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 6" | 4/5+ | 4 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**WARGEAR**

- [Heavy armour]
- [Sword]

**HEROIC ACTIONS**

- [Heroic March]

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Ancient Enemies] (Dwarf)
- [Ancient Enemies] (Elf)

- **Signal Tower** 

The Tower is placed in position before a battle commences, allowing for Azog to command his troops effectively from the start of the battle.

Before deployment, but after players have decided on their board edges, the controlling player may place the Signal Tower, plus the seven of Azog’s Lieutenants, anywhere on the battlefield. The Signal Tower may not be subsequently moved. Note: the Lieutenants must be deployed on the Signal Tower.

- **It must always be Manned (PASSIVE)**

Any of Azog’s Lieutenants may man a part of the Signal Tower – to do this they must be in base contact with the part they wish to man. Whilst manned, each part of the Signal Tower has a different effect, as follows:

• The Banner of Dol Guldur – All friendly Gundabad models on the battlefield count themselves as being in range of a banner.

• The Banner of Gundabad – All friendly Gundabad Hero models on the battlefield may declare Heroic Marches without reducing their store of Might.

• The Banner of Angmar – Whenever a friendly Gundabad model on the battlefield suffers a Wound, roll a D6. On the roll of a natural 6, the Wound is ignored exactly as if a point of Fate had been spent. Note that this supersedes other rules that confer similar effects, e.g., Fury.

• The Horn of Gorgoroth – Counts as a War Horn. Additionally, all enemy models on the battlefield suffer -1 to their Courage value. Note that this is not cumulative with other rules that confer similar penalties.

- **Summoning of the Hosts (PASSIVE)**

If the Signal Tower is taken as an upgrade for Azog, then 24 Warriors may be included in Azog’s warband rather than 18. These may deploy within 12" of Azog rather than the usual 6".

- **Destroying the Signal Tower (PASSIVE)** 

Each part of the Tower has a Defence value of 10 with 3 Wounds, and each is considered as a separate Battlefield target. Additionally, if an enemy model spends a full turn in base contact with any part of the Signal Tower without doing anything else (i.e., not shooting, using Magical Powers or fighting in combat), then that part of the Signal Tower is disabled and its effect is lost.

**THE WHITE WARG**

*WARG, INFANTRY, HERO*

| Mv | F | S | D | A | W | C | M | W | F |
|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 10" | 5/5+ | 5 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 1 |

**WARGEAR**

- Claws and teeth

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Fell Sight]
- [Terror]
- **Deadly Union (PASSIVE)**

As long as Azog is mounted upon the White Warg, you can expend either Azog’s or the White Warg’s stores of Might, Will and Fate as if they shared the same profile (though you should still mark down which of the two actually expended each point).

- **Pack Master (PASSIVE)**

Once separated from Azog, only Warg models may use the White Warg’s Stand Fast! rule or benefit from its Heroic Actions.

- **Raging Beast (PASSIVE)**

When Azog dismounts, the White Warg automatically passes its Courage test to stay and fight. Additionally, it will automatically pass all Courage tests for the rest of the battle.

- **Morgul Arrows (PASSIVE)**

Any model that suffers a Wound from a model with this special rule’s shooting attacks, and isn’t slain, must roll a D6 at the start of each subsequent turn. On the roll of a 1, that model suffers a Wound.

| Mv | F | S | D | A | W | C | M | W | F |
|:--:|:--:|:-:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|

**WARGEAR**

- [Sword]

**HEROIC ACTIONS**

- [Heroic March]

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Cave Dwellers]
- **Chittering Hordes (ACTIVE)**

Models with this special rule can Support as if they had spears, with the exception that they can only ever Support another model with the Chittering Hordes special rule. A Supporting model does get the benefit of having a two-handed weapon, if it has one.

- **Mercenary Ambush (ACTIVE)**

Warbands led by a Goblin Mercenary Captain that contain solely Goblin Mercenaries do not have to deploy on the board at the start of the game. Instead, they may be kept in reserve.

From turn 2 onwards, the controlling player must test to see if their Goblin Mercenaries have arrived. To do this, the Goblin Mercenary Captain must make a Courage test at any point during the controlling player’s Move phase.

If the test is passed, the controlling player may choose whether or not the Goblin Mercenaries have arrived. If the test is failed, then the opposing player may choose whether or not the Goblin Mercenaries have arrived.

Once they have arrived, the controlling player places the warband fully within any eligible terrain piece on the board. Models deployed in this way may not be placed within the Control Zones of any enemy models. This counts as the Goblin Mercenaries’ movement for that turn. If the entire warband cannot be placed for any reason (such as there are no eligible terrain pieces), then they may arrive as Reinforcements from a board edge of the controlling player’s choice instead.

- [Ancient Enemies] (Elf)

### CATAPULT TROLL [180 POINTS]
**TROLL, GUNDABAD, MONSTER, SIEGE ENGINE, INFANTRY**

| Mv | F | S | D | A | W | C |
|:--:|:--:|:-:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 6" | 6/4+ | 7 | 7 | 3 | 5 | 3 |

**WARGEAR**

- Catapult 
- Metal gauntlets

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Terror]

- **Catapult** 

A Catapult Troll always follows the rules for Volley Fire, giving it a range of 12"-96". Shots fired from the Catapult are resolved at Strength 10. When firing the Catapult, follow the rules for Siege Engines in the main rules manual with the following exceptions:

The Catapult Troll may still fire in the same turn that it has moved in, even if this is up to its full Move value. However, if the Catapult Troll has moved, it will only hit on the roll of a 6. The Catapult may still be fired whilst the Troll is in combat. If you wish to do this, and a 1 is rolled when rolling To Hit, the Catapult will malfunction and the Catapult Troll will suffer a wound. A Catapult Troll does not have a crew in the same way as a conventional Siege Engine – however, it is classed as a large Siege Engine and the Troll itself is considered to be the Siege Veteran. However, unlike other Siege Veterans, the Troll has no points of Might, Will or Fate. Unlike other Siege Engines, the Catapult Troll cannot be destroyed if a model spends its entire turn in base contact with it.

- **Area Effect**

If the Catapult scores a hit against a Battlefield target, all Mansized (or smaller) models within 2" are Knocked to the Ground. Cavalry models within 2" must take a Thrown Rider test. Additionally, any model within 2" also suffers a Strength 6 hit. 

- **Goblin Crew (ACTIVE)**

If the Catapult Troll wins the Fight, in addition to any Strikes that the Troll makes, the Goblin crew may also make Strikes against those in combat with the Troll. The Goblins inflict D6 Strength 3 Strikes if the Catapult Troll wins the Fight. Note that if the Catapult Troll uses a Brutal Power Attack, then the Goblins do not get these additional Strikes.

- **Metal Gauntlets (ACTIVE)**

Catapult Trolls never count as being unarmed. Furthermore, count their Strength as 10 when rolling for distance with a Hurl Brutal Power Attack.

**WARGEAR**

- [Flails][Flail]

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Fearless]
- [Terror]
- **Crushing Blow (ACTIVE)**

Each time a Troll Brute moves into base contact with another model, it must inflict a single Strength 10 hit upon that model. Cavalry models suffer these hits on both the rider and the mount. If the model is slain, then the Troll Brute may continue its move. If it is not slain, then the Troll Brute stops (exactly like a charging model would) and, if the model is an enemy, will fight it as normal in the Fight phase.

**SPECIAL RULES**

- **Relentless Advance (ACTIVE)**

When an Ogre charges into combat, they can pass 'through’ friendly Orc, Goblin and Bat models when they move and each model that they pass through suffers a Strength 3 hit.

A model with this special rule cannot be Compelled/Commanded over friendly models if it is forced to Charge as part of that Magical Power.
