Certain models have the ability to cast magical powers — whether these are cunning powers or dark sorcery, these powers are capable of changing the course of a battle. They range from subtle enchantments that are designed to manipulate or befuddle the enemy to those that can strengthen the resolve of friendly forces nearby or cause direct harm in the form of deadly black darts or fireballs. 

## USING MAGICAL POWERS

### WHO CAN USE MAGICAL POWERS

Any model with Magical Powers listed in their profile can use Magical Powers. Using Magical Powers also requires having Will points to spend -- so typically speaking, a model without any Will points will not be able to use any Magical Powers.

### WHEN CAN YOU USE MAGICAL POWERS?

A model with Magical Powers (and Will points available) can attempt to cast one (and only one) during each Move phase. They can use the power before they move, during their move or at the end of it. A **Hero** can even use a Magical Power in the same turn that it Charges, or if they don't move at all. A favoured ploy is to cast the Magical Power against the same model that you are charging, for instance.

A model that is already Engaged in combat cannot use a Magical Power.

### WHO CAN YOU TARGET?

Magical Powers come in three basic types: those that target a particular model, those that target all models within a certain distance and those that don't target anyone specific. Who, or what, the Magical Power can affect is made clear in the Magical Power's description.

A model can be targeted by a Magical Power even if it is Engaged in combat, unless the rules for the specific Magical Power state otherwise.

When targeting a **Cavalry** model with a Magical Power that states the Attacker must choose if the rider or mount is affected, the Attacker must choose before they make their Casting roll.

Whilst it is technically possible for a Good model to harm friendly models with a Magical Power (such as blasting a foe into them or dropping rocks on an enemy within range), this should only really be done as a last ditch attempt to save them from an even worse fate.

### CHECK RANGE AND LINE OF SIGHT

A model will need Line of Sight in order to target an enemy model with a Magical Power. Measure as you would for a missile weapon when working out whether your target is in range. The range of a Magical Power will either be in the entry of the casting model or in the description of the Magical
Power.

If a Magical Power targets a particular model, the caster must also be able to see their target — use the rules for Line of Sight [(see page 16]) when determining if a model can see their target.

### MAKING A CASTING ROLL

To successfully cast a Magical Power, the **Hero** must take a Casting test. Every Magical Power has a Casting value (given as a dice score), listed in the entry of the model casting it.

The controlling player states which Magical Power the **Hero** is attempting to cast and expends one or more Will points. For each Will point the **Hero** expends, they roll a D6. All the dice are rolled together and if the score on any of the dice equals or exceeds the Magical Power's Casting Value, the spell is successfully cast — resolve its effects as detailed in the Magical Power's entry.

If none of the dice have a high enough score, the Magical Power is not cast and has no effect. Remember, however, that **Hero** models that also have Might points can spend their Might to adjust their Casting rolls — one Might point for each number you increase by. If you wish to increase the Casting roll, you must do so immediately (as you will see later, it's important that your opponent knows what your final score is).

***CASTING ROLL***

*Frodo has been sapped of his Will at the hands of the Nazgûl, so Gandalf decides to attempt to replenish him with the Strengthen Will Magical Power.*

*Gandalf spends two Will points, and rolls a 3 and a 5. Since the Magical Power has a Casting value of 4+, the score of a 5 is high enough so the Casting test is passed and the Magical Power is cast successfully.*

## RESISTING A MAGICAL POWER

If a model is targeted by a Magical Power, there is a chance they can Resist its effects. Before resolving the effects of the power, the player controlling the target must decide whether to spend Will to Resist the Magic Power (assuming the model has any). This is called a Resist test.

For each Will point spent, the defending player rolls a D6 in their Resist test. If any of the dice equal or beat the Casting roll, the model has resisted the power and there is no effect. Note, the player must choose how many Will points to expend before rolling any dice. **Hero** models may use Might to increase the score of a Resist test. If, when making a Resist test, any of the dice rolled from spending Will points rolls a natural 6, the **Hero** immediately regains that point of Will. Note that rolling a natural 6 with 'free' points of Will (such as those from Resistant to Magic, Fortify Spirit or Heroic Resolve, etc.) does not confer this effect.

Some powers can affect a model indirectly — for instance, a **Hero** might be caught in the path of another model who has been hurled aside by the Sorcerous Blast Magical Power. In cases where a model is indirectly affected, but not the initial target of the power, no Resist roll can be made — so be careful where you place your models!

***CASTING AND RESISTING***

![](../media/rules_manual/casting_and_resisting_1.jpg)

*Gandalf is trying to help Thorin's Company escape from the Goblins pursuing them. Seeing that Grinnah is in range to charge* Ori, *Gandalf attempts to cast Immobilise (requiring a Casting roll of a 3+) in order to slow Grinnah down. Gandalf chooses Grinnah as his target and expends two Will points. Rolling his dice, Gandalf rolls a 1 and a 4, which is enough to cast the Magical Power. Grinnah, not wanting to be prevented from moving, decides to spend a Will point to make a Resist test and rolls a 5. The magical power has been resisted and Grinnah can continue its relentless pursuit of Thorin's Company.*

### RESISTING POWERS WITH NO TARGET

Some Magical Powers have no specific enemy target; some affect only the caster or friends within a certain distance, and so on. Magical Powers that do not affect enemy models cannot be resisted unless specified otherwise.

### RESISTING POWERS WITH MULTIPLE TARGETS

Some Magical Powers affect several enemies (such as Nature's Wrath, for instance). Such Magical Powers can only be resisted by a single model — their targets' controlling player chooses any one of the models in range to Resist the Magical Power. Expend their Will and take the Resist test as described above. If the test is passed, then the Magical Power has no effect on any of the models in range. If they fail, then all models in range are affected. If a Channelled power increases the number of models targeted to multiple models, any one of the targeted models can take the Resist test.

## MAGICAL POWER DURATIONS

Every Magical Power has a duration that specifies how long it lasts. The effects of a Magical Power automatically come to an end if the caster is slain or leaves the battlefield. Some Magical Powers have a special or unique duration, in these cases, it is made clear in the Magical Power's description. The three standard Magical Power durations are explained below:

### INSTANT

Magical Powers with this duration take effect straight away. After they are resolved, they end. These Magical Powers tend to be those that cause damage, such as Black Dart or Sorcerous Blast.

### TEMPORARY

Magical Powers with this duration remain in play until the End phase of the turn in which they are cast, such as Immobilise or Shroud of Shadows.

### EXHAUSTION

Magical Powers with this duration remain in play until the caster reaches 0 Will points, such as Aura of Dismay or Fortify Spirit.

### HEROIC CHANNELLING

Heroic Channelling is a Heroic Action (see page 68). When a **Hero** uses this Heroic Action, their Magical Powers become magnified, providing greater (or different) effects; the **Hero** will benefit from the exceptions for the Channelled power, instead of the ordinary rules.

## MAGICAL POWERS LIST

### AURA OF COMMAND

**DURATION: EXHAUSTION**

This power targets the caster themselves. While this power is in effect, the caster and all friendly models within 6" automatically pass any Courage tests they are required to make.

**Channelled** – The range of this power is increased to 12".

### AURA OF DISMAY

**DURATION: EXHAUSTION**

This power targets the caster themself. While this power is in effect, the caster and all friendly models within 6" cause Terror.

**Channelled** — The range of this power is increased to 12".

### BANISHMENT

**DURATION: INSTANT**

This power targets one enemy model within range. This power only affects Spirit models. The target model automatically suffers 1 Wound, exactly as if it had been wounded in combat. If the target is a **Cavalry** model, the caster must choose whether the rider or the mount suffers the effects.

**Channelled** — The target suffers D3 Wounds rather than 1.

### BLACK DART

**DURATION: INSTANT**

This power targets one enemy model within range. The target immediately suffers one Strength 9 hit. Do not roll To Hit or for In The Way tests. If the target is a **Cavalry** model then the Attacker must choose whether the rider or the mount is hit. This power can still be used on a target that is Engaged in combat.

**Channelled** — A wounding hit will cause D3 Wounds rather than 1.

### BLADEWRATH

**DURATION: TEMPORARY**

This power targets one friendly model within range. In the Fight phase, all Strikes made by the target model are resolved at Strength 6, regardless of other modifiers.

**Channelled** — All Strikes are instead resolved at Strength 10.

### BLESSING OF THE VALAR

**DURATION: INSTANT**

This power targets one friendly model within range. They immediately recover a Fate point spent earlier in the battle. This may not take a model's Fate beyond its starting level. If the target is a **Cavalry** model, the caster must choose whether the rider or the mount recovers the Fate point.

**Channelled** — The target instead recovers D3 Fate.

### BLINDING LIGHT

**DURATION: TEMPORARY**

This power targets the caster themselves. While this power is in effect, any shooting attacks directed at the caster, or a friendly model within 6" of them, will only hit on a To Hit roll of a 6. Additionally, an area within a 12" radius around the caster is illuminated as if it were daylight (perfect when you are fighting underground!).

**Channelled** — The duration becomes Exhaustion.

### CALL WINDS

**DURATION: INSTANT**

This power targets one enemy model within range. The target is blown D6" directly away from the caster in a straight line. If the model comes into contact with another model or terrain such as an Obstacle like a hedge, house or large rock, then it will stop 1" away from it. In either case the target model is knocked Prone. If the target is in combat, the effect is the same as described above, but every other model in the combat is also knocked Prone.

**Channelled** — The target is instead blown 2D6" away.

### CHILL SOUL

**DURATION: INSTANT**

This power targets one enemy model within range. The target model suffers a Wound, exactly as if it had been wounded in combat. If cast on a **Cavalry** model, the Attacker decides whether the rider or the mount suffers the Wound. This power may be cast on a model Engaged in close combat.

**Channelled** — The range of this Magical Power is increased by 6".

### COLLAPSE ROCKS

**DURATION: INSTANT**

This power targets one enemy model within range. This power may only be cast on a model that is within a ruin, stone or brick building, cave, rock pile or another similar piece of terrain where a Wizard could crack rocks either underfoot or overhead. The target suffers one Strength 5 hit.

**Channelled** — All models (friend and foe) within 2" of the target also suffer one Strength 5 hit.

### COMMAND/COMPEL

**DURATION: TEMPORARY**

This power targets one enemy model within range. The caster may move the target model up to half of its maximum Move distance. They can do this even if the model has already moved this turn. The move cannot force the target to jump, leap, climb, dismount or lie down, but can take them into difficult terrain, and even make them Charge an enemy. No Courage test is required to Charge Terror-causing foes. It can even force an unengaged victim to drop an object (but not wargear) that it is holding or to put on The One Ring (if they carry it). Once the target has finished the move, it may move no further that turn for any reason. Finally, the target suffers the effect of the Immobilise/Transfix magical power.

**Channelled** — Additionally, while this power is in effect, the target will halve their Fight and Attacks characteristics (rounding up), and may not Strike if they win a Duel.

### CURSE

**DURATION: INSTANT**

This power targets one enemy model within range. The target model immediately loses 1 Fate point. If the target is a **Cavalry** model, the caster must choose whether the rider or the mount loses the Fate point.

**Channelled** — The target model immediately loses all remaining Fate points.

### DRAIN COURAGE

**DURATION: INSTANT**

This power targets one enemy model within range. The target immediately reduces their Courage characteristic by 1 for the remainder of the battle, to a minimum of 1. This power can take effect multiple times over the course of a battle, reducing the target's Courage each time. If the target is a **Cavalry** model, the caster must choose whether the rider or the mount reduces their Courage value.

**Channelled** — The target's Courage is instead reduced by D3.

### ENCHANTED BLADES

**DURATION: TEMPORARY**

This power targets one friendly model within range. In the Fight phase, the target may re-roll all failed To Wound rolls.

This power targets one friendly model within range. This power can be used against a single Bat, (unridden) Warg or Spider model within range. If successful, the target's Fight, Attacks, Strength and Courage are increased by 2 until the End phase. During the End phase, the target suffers one Strength 10 hit.

**Channelled** — The target's Fight, Attacks, Strength and Courage are instead increased by 3.

### FLAMEBURST

**DURATION: INSTANT**

**Channelled** — The target instead suffers the effects of the Set Ablaze special rule.

### FORTIFY SPIRIT

**DURATION: EXHAUSTION**

This power may target one friendly model within range. While this power is in effect, the target rolls two extra dice when making Resist tests. These extra dice do not reduce the target's store of Will and can even be rolled if the target has no Will points remaining or chooses not to expend any Will.

**Channelled** — The target also adds 1 to their highest dice score when resisting magic.

### FURY (X)

**DURATION: EXHAUSTION**

Every model with this Magical Power will have a bracket after Fury denoting the models that will be affected by the power (e.g., Fury (Goblin)). This power targets all friendly models within 6" that are included in the bracket. Whilst this power is in effect, all targets will automatically pass any Courage tests they are required to make. In the case of **Cavalry** models, a degree of common sense is required when applying this effect.

**Channelled** — Additionally, each time a target suffers a Wound whilst within range of at least one friendly model that has cast Fury, roll a D6. On the roll of a 6, the target ignores the Wound exactly as if a point of Fate had been spent. This roll is taken immediately after the Wound has been suffered, can be taken before Fate rolls are made and Might may be used to influence it.

### IMMOBILISE/TRANSFIX

**DURATION: TEMPORARY**

This power targets one enemy model within range. While this power is in effect, the target model may not move (except to Back Away should they lose a Fight), shoot, cast Magical Powers, declare Heroic Actions, call a Stand Fast! or use Active abilities and may not Strike if they win a Duel.

**Channelled** — Additionally, while this power is in effect, the target will halve their Fight and Attacks characteristics (rounding up).

### INSTILL FEAR

**DURATION: INSTANT**

This power targets all enemy models within range. Each affected model must take a Courage test, in an order chosen by the caster; if the test is failed then the model must move its maximum Move distance directly away from the caster. If a model comes into base contact with the edge of the board, they will immediately stop moving.

**Channelled** — Courage tests caused by this Magical Power are taken on 3D6, discarding the highest result.

### NATURE'S WRATH

**DURATION: INSTANT**

### PANIC STEED

**DURATION: INSTANT**
