CITADEL OR FORGE WORLD MODELS","text":"<p>This may seem obvious, but you will need some Citadel or Forge World models in order to play. Whether this is a specific collection to faithfully recreate a scene from the films, or just a selection of your favourite models arranged into an army of your own making, the choice is up to you. As you play your first few games, you'll probably find yourself using unpainted models, but as almost every hobbyist will agree, playing a game with fully painted armies both looks and feels better!</p>"},{"location":"#2-dice-and-tape-measures","title":"2. DICE AND TAPE MEASURES","text":"<p>We use tape measures or measuring sticks to see how far our models can move across the battlefield each turn, whether they are in bow range and for many other distance-related reasons. To this end, it is important to have a measuring device on hand that measures in inches. The Battle of Pelennor Fields boxed game contains a handy ruler, or you can pick up a tape measure from any Games Workshop store.</p> <p>Dice are required to see if our models are successful in their in-game endeavours, to see whether an arrow hits its target, who wins in a fight and all manner of other things. As such, you will need a selection of six-sided dice at your disposal (between eight and twelve, preferably in a few different colours, is about right).</p> <p>REFRESHMENTS</p> <p>In the finest tradition of Hobbits everywhere, it's often a good idea to have a selection of sensible snacks, such as biscuits and seed cakes, available for you and your opponent, as well as having something nice to drink (Jay will rarely go through a whole game without a nice hot mug of tea in his hand!).</p>"},{"location":"#3-playing-area","title":"3.

These stories are often focused around a small group of unlikely heroes embarking on seemingly impossible quests and adventures as they strive to overcome the evil that stands in front of them. Thorin's Company numbered just 15 when they set out from Bag End to try to reclaim their homeland of Erebor from the clutches of Smaug; and the Fellowship of the Ring consisted of only nine heroes from across the races of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, yet were able to endure great hardship and overthrow the Dark Lord Sauron.</p> <p>It is this sense of taking a small group of heroes and having them embark on fantastical journeys of daring and adventure that this supplement allows you to accomplish.

Battle Companies is designed so that players can use their imagination to tell a story, and this may, and often does, result in a few changes to the core rules of Battle Companies \u2014 and this makes for some really fun, unique and personal campaigns, which at its heart is what Battle Companies is all about!</p> <p>Often, all players in a campaign will implement a selection of additional rules for use in their games, and this is perfectly fine \u2014 in fact it is often encouraged! After all, Battle Companies is about playing a series of narrative and thematic Scenarios that further a particular storyline, and so adding in a series of extra rules that helps to accomplish this can only be a good thing.</p> <p>So, over the next few pages, we will present you with a selection of additional rules that you can use in your games. Some are good for using in almost any situation, whilst others provide rules for slightly more unusual situations that the players in a campaign may want to use for a one off Scenario. There is no pressure to use these rules if you don't fancy doing so, and you are more than welcome to make up your own if you wish.

To do this, you can spend any amount of Influence Points to place a bounty on a Hero \u2014 let your campaign organiser know so that they can keep track of the bounty. Any player can add to the bounty at any time by doing the same \u2014 the bigger the bounty on a Hero, the more likely that other companies will focus their energy on killing them. If at any point a player successfully kills the targeted Hero (note that this means killing them outright, not just having them removed from the battlefield in a game), then they may collect the bounty from the campaign organiser and add it to their Influence pool.</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/additional_rules/#holding-a-hero-to-ransom","title":"HOLDING A HERO TO RANSOM","text":"<p>Losing a Hero in Battle Companies is always a troublesome thing; the hole they can leave in your company's roster is often hard to fill. After a particularly difficult game, you may find that one of your Hero models has been lost in battle; captured by the enemy forces following the skirmish that has just ensued. Normally, the rules would call for the player who lost their Hero in battle to play the Secure the Area Scenario as their next game with their lost Hero as the objective \u2014 if they win they rescue the Hero, if not the Hero will perish.</p> <p>However, you can always play an alternative if you wish in that the other company has captured your Hero and is now holding them to ransom, and will relinquish them if their demands are met. The demands could be set as a standard ransom value before the campaign starts, paying between 3-5 Influence Points to your opponent is around a fair price, or you could set your own demands when the situation arises. This could be anything from a set amount of Influence Points, a piece of wargear available to the other company that your company could not normally get, or even a cup of tea or a cake \u2014 whatever you feel would best suit the situation and provide the best narrative!</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/additional_rules/#leaders-courage","title":"LEADER'S COURAGE","text":"<p>A Battle Company can often end up having multiple Heroes, which means that when the company Breaks during a game they will all have to take their Courage tests individually, as Hero models cannot normally benefit from the Stand Fast! of other Hero models.</p> <p>One additional rule you can use is allowing the Sergeants of your Battle Company to benefit from the Stand Fast! of your leader, meaning that your leader can keep your force fighting as one.

However, they must take on at least four other Battle Companies at the same time. These other companies have put aside their differences for now in order to bring down the terrifying war beast. If the M\u00fbmak is slain, the other companies are all victorious. If the Harad or Far Harad player can kill all of the models from the other companiesn then they are the winner. Remember that they may only have a M\u00fbmak in these situations! It doesn't have to just be M\u00fbmakil that you allow in your own campaigns, perhaps a Gundabad player would like a Gundabad Troll, or a Rivendell player may want an Eagle to join them; so long as your campaign participants agree on conditions to balance and justify it, it can be great fun to do!</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/additional_rules/#playing-two-against-one","title":"PLAYING TWO AGAINST ONE","text":"<p>As a campaign goes on, you will often find that some Battle Companies' Ratings start to soar, whilst others seem to struggle to advance so far no matter how many Influence Points they gain from the Against the Odds bonus.</p> <p>One way of counteracting this is to allow games where it is two against one, when the Battle Company Rating is roughly equal on both sides. For example, if two players with a Rating of 150 play against one player who has a rating of 300 that would, in theory, be a fair fight. This will provide the two lower Battle Companies a fair chance of knocking the other company down a peg or two, whilst providing them with a decent challenge along the way. If you do decide to do this, you should count the Ratings of both allied Battle Companies as one for the purposes of working out the Against the Odds bonus.</p> <p>Hopefully, you have found some of these additional rules to be fun and interesting; perhaps they have inspired you to add them to your own campaign, or even to think of some of your own ideas to use to enhance the narrative stories that your games of Battle Companies create.

From lush and vibrant forests to the ruined Dwarven kingdoms of old to humble fishing settlements, a Battle Company can be forced to engage in a skirmish in almost any place \u2014 and must be ready to take up their weapons at a moment's notice.</p> <p>Over the next few pages we will present a series of rules for fighting your battles in a variety of different locations in Middle- earth. Some of these represent specific places, such as Lake-town or Goblin-town, whilst many could represent a multitude of places across Middle-earth. For example, forests could be used to represent Mirkwood, Fangorn and many more.</p> <p>The rules provided here are by no means exhaustive, but some of them can be applied to various Scenarios during the Narrative Campaign found on page 92. If you want to create your own rules for fighting battles in other locations, feel free to try your hand at it. Creating your own rules for other locations can provide a very personal feel to your games of Battle Companies, and can make every game feel unique.</p> <p>Also, some of the rules for these locations can provide a great basis for other areas of Middle-earth.

Her former strongholds and rich cities are now nothing more than piles of rubble, haunted by the chilling voices of those that once ruled them. It has even been said that Evil spirits lurk within the crumbling stone, bound to the dark powers that once conquered their lands.</p> <p>Often, Battle Companies will venture into these ruined places in search of riches or items of great power from ages long since past, unaware of the perils they are wandering into. For the spirits that dwell within the haunted ruins see the members of a Battle Company as easy targets to sacrifice in the name of the dark power that binds them.</p> <p>Games that take place within Haunted Ruins should feature a wide selection of different buildings, ruins and similar. All of these are subject to the following rules:</p> <p>CHILLING AURA \u2014 Though it was once a proud building of a noble kingdom now long forgotten, it is hard to deny the chilling feeling that those pure of heart sense whilst within its walls.</p> <p>Good models within a Haunted Ruin suffer a -1 penalty to their Courage value whilst within it.</p> <p>SPIRITS OF THOSE LONG DEAD \u2014 As rival Battle Companies fight amongst the ruins, the twisted, lingering spirit of the realm's former king has been stirred and now seeks to exact his revenge upon those that have entered his domain.</p> <p>For any game featuring Haunted Ruins, players will need a number of identical markers equal to the number of ruins on the board, one of which should be marked underneath. The markers should be randomised and one should be placed in each ruin so that neither player knows which one is marked. The first time a model moves within a ruin, flip the marker over. If it is unmarked, nothing happens, remove it from play. If it is marked, the model has disturbed the restless spirit within the ruin. Immediately place a Barrow-wight within the centre of the ruin. The Barrow-wight will always move first in each Move phase, even before Heroic Moves, and will charge the nearest model from either Battle Company by the shortest possible route. If this is not possible, it will move as quickly as possible towards the nearest model from either Battle Company. If, before the Barrow-wight moves, there are models within 6\" of it, the Barrow-wight will try to cast the Paralyse Magical Power using a single Will point on the closest model, so long as it has Will points remaining.</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/adventures_in_middle_earth/#lake-town","title":"LAKE-TOWN","text":"<p>Upon the waters of the Long Lake sits the humble fishing settlement of Esgaroth, a meagre town filled with impoverished people. Even in its relative poverty, trade still manages to trickle into it, its creaking walkways dotted with stalls, markets and numerous barrels of fish, adding a pungent fishy smell to the already downtrodden settlement that resides atop the cruel and unforgiving lake.</p> <p>Although Esgaroth usually provides a 'safe' haven for travellers, it is not unheard of for opposing Battle Companies to enter into violent disagreement in one of the town's many taverns. Often these disagreements can form into fully-fledged skirmishes that will claim lives.</p> <p>DOORWAYS \u2014 The many houses that are built atop the Long Lake can provide a variety of extra pathways and shortcuts for warriors to traverse Esgaroth.</p> <p>A Man-sized (or smaller) model that starts its Move phase in base contact with a door on a Lake-town House may choose to enter the house instead of moving. The model spends its turn running through the house (no doubt knocking over chairs, tables and various other items as it goes) and is placed in base contact with any other door on the Lake-town House. A model that moves in this way counts as having moved its full Movement allowance. If the model cannot be placed in base contact with another door for whatever reason, then it cannot move in this way.</p> <p>BOATS \u2014 Many folk of Lake-town are fishermen or bargemen. As such, it is commonplace in Lake-town for most families to own a boat, which they use to fish or cross the Long Lake.</p> <p>A model may enter or exit a boat by passing a Jump test. A boat has limited space and as such only two Man-sized (or smaller) models may occupy a single boat. An unengaged model that is in a boat may row it up to 6\" in any direction upon the water. If two enemy models are in the same boat, they count as Engaged and will fight each other in the Fight phase. As models in a boat cannot Back Away, any model that loses a Duel roll whilst in a boat counts as Trapped.</p> <p>ICE FLOES \u2014 The freezing waters of the Long Lake are strewn with numerous ice floes. Although these sheets of ice provide a cunning warrior with an alternative pathway across Lake-town, even the most sure-footed can find themselves upended by the ice's treacherous surface.</p> <p>At the start of each turn, determine the direction that the lake is flowing. This can be done with a roll of a D6, letting the player with Priority choose or by using a Scatter dice. Each Ice Floe is moved D3\" in the chosen direction. Any models that moved during the Move phase and end their move on an Ice Floe must roll a D6. On a 1, that model loses its footing and falls into the lake. Any model that falls into the freezing waters is removed as a casualty.</p> <p>BARRELS \u2014 Lake-town is constantly littered with barrels containing all manner of exciting things, from fish to ale to countless other goods. A well- timed kick of one of these can knock over countless adversaries as it barrels down the streets of Esgaroth.</p> <p>A Barrel is a Heavy Object. Any model carrying a barrel may choose to kick it D6\" towards the enemy, even moving through other models. Any model that the barrel moves through must roll a D6. On a 1-2, the model is immediately knocked Prone and suffers a Strength 1 hit. Place the Barrel where it finishes its movement \u2014 it gives your opponent the chance to kick it right back! Barrels that enter the Long Lake are removed from play.</p> <p>FISH BASKETS \u2014 Esgaroth is a fishing settlement, and as such, baskets and barrels of recent catches can be seen on almost every street corner and table. A well-placed slap with a fish will disorientate anyone who is on the receiving end of the slimy makeshift weapon.</p> <p>If a model that is in base contact with a Fish Basket wins a Duel roll, they may choose to slap one enemy model with a fish instead of making Strikes. Any model that is slapped with a fish suffers a Strength 1 hit. Additionally, they may not move during the following Move phase and are reduced to Fight 1/6+ until the End phase of the following turn.</p> <p>LANTERNS \u2014 When the skies turn dark, the streets of Lake-town are dotted with lanterns that light up its streets, outlining the edges of the walkways for the townsfolk.</p> <p>Many of the Scenarios in Lake-town take place at night. When this is the case, models can only see other models that are within 12\" of them. A model within 3\" of a Lantern can be targeted at any distance.</p> <p>SLIPPERY WALKWAYS \u2014 The walkways of Lake-town are constantly wet from the waters of the Long Lake, not to mention the fish that often litter the streets, which causes them to become slippery and dangerous for those fighting atop them.</p> <p>Whenever a model Backs Away as a result of losing a  Duel roll, it must roll a D6. On a 1, that model slips on a particularly wet piece of wood (or potentially a stray fish) and is knocked Prone. Note that this happens before Strikes are made, which means that any model that slips will therefore be Prone when its opponent makes its Strikes!</p> <p>FENDERS \u2014 These lightweight wicker objects are designed to prevent boats from crashing into the docks. However, they can also be used to deliver a swift thwack to an enemy in times of desperation.</p> <p>A Fender is a Light Object. At any point during its Move phase, a model carrying a Fender may use it to hit a single enemy model within 1\" of itself. On a 4+, the model hit with a Fender is knocked Prone.</p> <p>OUTHOUSES \u2014 An outhouse can make for a very good, albeit smelly, hiding place (not many people are inconsiderate enough to enter an outhouse while its door is shut!), and can conceal its occupant from enemies that traverse Lake-town.</p> <p>During the Move phase, a Man-sized (or smaller) model that is in base contact with the door of an unoccupied Outhouse may choose to enter it. Whilst within an Outhouse, a model cannot be targeted or seen by enemy models and has no Control Zone. Models inside an Outhouse cannot draw Line of Sight and therefore may not Shoot, cast Magical Powers or use any special rules that target a specific enemy or friendly model. They may, however, Charge out of an Outhouse as if they did have Line of Sight from the door of the Outhouse.</p> <p>Each Move phase, a single model may attempt to open the Outhouse door, revealing anyone hiding inside by being in base contact and rolling a D6. On a 6, the model inside has been found and is subsequently charged by the model that found it. As there is nowhere to Back Away to in an Outhouse, if the model inside loses a Duel roll, it will automatically be Trapped.</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/adventures_in_middle_earth/#forests","title":"FORESTS","text":"<p>Middle-earth is strewn with numerous forests and woodlands with histories stretching back as far as records, or memories, recall. Each of these forests is different, with each harbouring its own secrets and dangers from the wider world.

At the start of the game, before deployment, players should roll to see which of the forests of Middle-earth they are fighting in \u2014 or simply choose from the list if there is one that particularly suits your game. All pieces of woodland terrain will automatically be of the same type, depending on the result of the D6.</p> D6 Result 1 NORMAL FOREST  Normal Forests have no additional rules. 2 HAUNTED FOREST (ANGMAR)  At the start of each Move phase, randomly select D3 pieces of woodland terrain. The closest model to each of the selected pieces must pass a Courage test or suffer the effects of the Transfix Magical Power. 3 SPIDER-INFESTED FOREST (MIRKWOOD)  At the end of each Move phase, randomly select one piece of woodland terrain on the board and place a single Mirkwood Spider within the centre (or as close as possible). This Mirkwood Spider will then move as fast as it can towards the nearest model from either Battle Company, Charging if possible. If the Mirkwood Spider is not in combat during the Shoot phase, it may shoot its Spider Webs at the closest visible model if it is in range. 4 GUARDED FOREST (DR\u00daADAN, NORTHERN FORESTS)  During each Shoot phase, roll a D6 for each model either in a piece of woodland terrain or within 3\" of one. On a 1 or 2, that model suffers a Strength 2 hit as if it was shot with a bow from the edge of the woodland terrain closest to the model. If there are any In The Way rolls to be made, such as if the model is in combat, or if there is other terrain or models in the arrow's path then any In The Way rolls will still need to be made. 5 WRATHFUL FOREST (FANGORN, OLD FOREST)  At the start of each Move phase, roll a D6 for each model in base contact with or within a piece of woodland terrain. On a 1 or 2, that model suffers a Strength 6 hit as the trees lash out against them. 6 HAVEN FOREST (LOTHL\u00d3RIEN)  Any Evil model that is even partially within a Haven Forest suffers a penalty of -1 to their Courage value while they remain within it."},{"location":"battle_companies/adventures_in_middle_earth/#goblin-town","title":"GOBLIN-TOWN","text":"<p>Beneath The Misty Mountains, further north than the kingdom of Moria, is the dismal dwelling of Goblin- town.

Yet as the ages rolled on, some began to fall into ruin, either attacked and overrun by Goblins and Orcs, or even taken by some form of darker power altogether. It was precisely this that saw the greatest kingdom of the Dwarves fall. The Dwarves of Khazad-d\u00fbm delved too greedily and too deep, awakening a Balrog of Morgoth and thus sealing their doom.</p> <p>If a Battle Company needs to cross The Misty Mountains, and doesn't fancy passing too close to the threats posed by Goblin-town, they may risk the road through Khazad-d\u00fbm \u2014 or the black pit of Moria as it has hence become known.

There are plenty of options for your company members to spend their hard earned Influence Points on, from mounts to weapons and armour.</p> <p>The list presented on the next page is by no means exhaustive; certain Battle Companies may have their own list of additional wargear that can be bought for them. Where this is the case it will be presented on that Battle Company's page, along with any costs associated with that piece of wargear.</p> <p>There are a few restrictions to which pieces of wargear can be purchased for the members of your Battle Company. This is to ensure that the Battle Companies progress in a thematic manner that fits with their background, rather than simply loading every model in your Battle Company with wargear they would not really have access to.</p> <p>For the Warrior models in your Battle Company, this is really easy to work out. They can simply purchase any piece of wargear that model's profile would normally be able to have. For example, a Warrior of Minas Tirith from a Battle Company would be able to buy a bow, shield or spear, as those options are directly available to their profile. They would not be able to buy a horse, lance or Elf bow, as those options are not available to their profile.</p> <p>Hero models are much less limited by which pieces of wargear they can take. They can purchase any piece of wargear that is available to any member of their Battle Company, including those that could be promoted or join as Reinforcements; but not those that joined the Battle Company by other means (such as Wanderers or those from the Narrative Campaign). If a member of your Battle Company happens to gain a piece of wargear that they could not normally have through a Narrative Campaign, this does not mean that your Hero models may also purchase the same type of wargear.</p> <p>Next to each wargear entry are two numbers in brackets separated by a slash. These denote the amount of points that the piece of wargear will add to a Hero model as explained on page 9.</p> <p>For example: Jay has a Minas Tirith Battle Company and wants to purchase some wargear for his leader. Jay may purchase a horse for his leader as the Knights of Minas Tirith can have a horse. He could also purchase a longbow, as Citadel Guard can have a longbow. Jay could not purchase a two-handed weapon for his leader as no member of his Battle Company is able to have a two-handed weapon.</p> <ul> <li>ARMOURED HORSE (8/15) [4 Influence Points]</li> <li>BOW (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>CROSSBOW (2/5) [2 Influence Points]</li> <li>DWARF BOW (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>DWARF LONGBOW (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>ELF BOW (2/5) [2 Influence Points]</li> <li>ELVEN-MADE HAND-AND-A-HALF SWORD (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>ESGAROTH BOW (2/5) [2 Influence Points]</li> <li>FELL WARG (5/10) [3 Influence Points]</li> <li>HORSE (5/10) [3 Influence Points]</li> <li>LANCE (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>LONGBOW (2/5) [2 Influence Points]</li> <li>ORC BOW (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>PIKE (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>SHIELD (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>SHORT BOW (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>SPEAR (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>SWAP HAND WEAPON FOR ANOTHER TYPE (1/5) [1 Influence Point] </li> </ul> <p>Any model may change the type of hand weapon they possess for any of the following: axe, club, dagger, flail, hammer, mace, maul, pick, scourge, staff, or sword.

Each piece of Equipment has a number in brackets after its name; this is the number of points it will add onto the rating of your Battle Company (see page 9).</p> <ul> <li>ARROW POISON SMALL (1) [1 Influence Point]</li> </ul> <p>A tactic made famous by the Haradrim of the south, many Evil creatures will coat the tips of their arrows in poison to cause great pain to those that succumb to its potency.</p> <p>A model with Arrow Poison must re-roll To Wound rolls of a 1 when making a shooting attack.

Only Evil models may purchase Blade Poison.</p> <ul> <li>CLIMBING ROPES SMALL (1) [1 Influence Point]</li> </ul> <p>Along their travels, members of a Battle Company will have to traverse many areas that need to be climbed, making ropes an essential piece of equipment.</p> <p>A model with Climbing Ropes will add +1 to any Climb tests they make. Additionally, after the model makes a Climb test they may choose to leave their rope behind. If they do so they cannot use it for the rest of the game, mark the location with a marker, counter or token. Any friendly model that makes a Climb test from the same point also gains a bonus of +1 to the result.

Leaders of a Battle Company will often provide their comrades with such a drink, and the promise of one can bring out the best in almost any fighter.</p> <p>A Hero model may elect to use their Dwarven Brew at the start of any game, if they do so it has been used and is removed from the Hero model's profile.

It is said to be even better than the honey-cakes of the Beornings and that even a small amount can prepare a Man for a full day's march.</p> <p>A model that has purchased Elvish Waybread may elect to use it at the end of any game in which they were removed as a casualty. If they do this, remove the Elvish Waybread from their Equipment; additionally, do not roll on the Injury chart for them, instead they will automatically count as having rolled the Full Recovery result. Only Good models may purchase Elvish Waybread.</p> <ul> <li>HEALING HERBS (HERO ONLY) SMALL (3) [3 Influence Points]</li> </ul> <p>There are many flora and fungi in Middle-earth that have healing or medicinal properties.

If they do this, instead of rolling To Wound, roll a single D6 instead.

If they do, you may keep D3 Warrior models off the board when deploying your forces. These models will arrive from any board edge of your choosing at the end of your company's second Move phase via the rules for Reinforcements. Once read, the scroll is caught by a strong breeze and floats off into the air; remove it from the Hero model's Equipment.</p> <ul> <li>SEEING STONE (HERO ONLY) SMALL (5) [6 Influence Points]</li> </ul> <p>This mysterious stone swirls with an unknown power. Quite what power it possesses remains uncertain, but those who wield it seem to know what may happen before it comes to pass.</p> <p>At the start of each turn that the Hero is alive, roll a D6 before Priority is rolled. On the roll of a natural 6, the Hero may choose which side has Priority that turn.</p> <ul> <li>TORCH SMALL(1) [1 Influence Point]</li> </ul> <p>Warriors will use torches to light the way in caves or the dark of night.

Additionally, a model with a Torch can use it to attempt to set their foes on fire. If this model wins a Duel roll, they may choose to not make any Strikes and instead roll a D6. On a 6, the model that lost the Duel roll suffers the Set Ablaze special rule.</p> <ul> <li>WAR DRUM LARGE (10) [3 Influence Points]</li> </ul> <p>Many bands of Orcs, Uruk-hai or other Evil beings will march into battle to the rhythmic beat of a war drum, the constant thumping of the drum making sure that no member of the company slows down and falls behind.</p> <p>At the start of the Move phase, a model with a War Drum may declare they are sounding the advance. When this occurs, all models from the same Battle Company, and within 12\" of the drummer, add 3\" to their Movement value if on foot and 5\" to their Movement if mounted for the remainder of the turn. Models that are affected by a War Drum may not Charge in that turn. Only Evil models may purchase a War Drum.</p> <ul> <li>WHIP SMALL (2) [1 Influence Point]</li> </ul> <p>Among the Evil races of Middle-earth, whips are used to viciously spur on the rank and file into battle.

Remove the Hero, and all of their wargear, from your Battle Company Roster. 3 Lost in Battle \u2014 The Hero lies wounded upon the field of battle; their followers either unable to find them or having mistaken them for one of the fallen. The Hero model's Battle Company must play the Secure the Area or A Daring Rescue Scenario as their next game with the lost Hero as the objective. In the Secure the Area scenario, the Hero may not act in any way, shape or form, and may not be charged, targeted or damaged in any way (they are essentially an Objective marker).

If the game is a draw, then the Hero is rescued but must miss the next game their company participates in. If, however, they are defeated then the Hero is captured and considered Dead. 4 Arm Wound \u2014 The Hero has taken a serious wound to one of their arms, rendering it all but useless. From this point on, the Hero cannot carry a shield, wield a two-handed weapon, use a hand-and-a-half weapon two-handed, or fire a bow or crossbow of any sort (though they may still use throwing weapons). They may only use single-handed weapons from this point forward. Should the Hero suffer another Arm Wound at any point, they will be forced to retire, as per the Dead result. 5 Leg Wound \u2014 The Hero has sustained a vicious injury to their leg, causing them to limp and become slower as a result. The Hero has their Move value permanently reduced by 1\". Should the Hero suffer another Leg Wound at any point, they will be forced to retire, as per the Dead result. 6-8 Full Recovery \u2014 Fortune has been kind, the injuries suffered are of no lasting effect. The Hero may play in the next game as normal. Additionally, the Hero heals one Leg Wound, Arm Wound or Old Battle Wound they previously obtained. 9 It's just a Scratch \u2014 Although not life threatening, the Hero must rest in order to heal. They must miss the next game. Alternatively, the Hero may roll again on this chart \u2014 however, the second result will apply even if it is worse than the first. 10 Old Battle Wound \u2014 Although the Hero essentially makes a Full Recovery, they will never really be the same. The wounds that they suffered in battle will crop up from time to time, rendering the Hero unable to fight. At the start of each game this Hero participates in, roll a D6. On a 1, the Hero must miss that game. It is possible for a Hero to have multiple Old Battle Wounds, in which case they will roll a D6 for each one. 11 The Wounds of a Hero \u2014 The Hero's allies are so impressed by the Hero's resilience and quick recovery that they are richly rewarded. The Hero model's Battle Company immediately gains an extra D6 Influence Points; additionally, the Hero makes a Full Recovery. 12 Protected by the Valar \u2014 Saved by the Valar, or perhaps some darker force, the Hero is protected from harm. The Hero makes a Full Recovery. Additionally, the Hero permanently gains +1 Fate point (to a maximum of 3). <p>As you will no doubt have noticed, Hero models are less likely to die than Warrior models.

There are Battle Companies to represent most of the numerous different factions, kingdoms and alliances from all over Middle-earth, so we are confident that you will be able to find one that suits your particular tastes. </p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/mustering_your_warband/#step-1-gather-your-force","title":"STEP 1 \u2014 GATHER YOUR FORCE","text":"<p>This book contains 38 different Battle Companies from all parts of Middle-earth. From the White City of Minas Tirith to the arid deserts of Harad, and from the rolling hills of the Shire to the cavernous halls of Moria, you will find Battle Companies to represent almost all of the fighting forces of Middle-earth from page 30 onwards. Each Battle Company has a section of background introducing them, how their companies are formed and what their goals are. Each entry also has its own starting Battle Company, a list of the Advancements available to members of that company, Reinforcements chart(s), and a unique special rule that is only available to the Heroes from that company.</p> <p>After you have chosen the Battle Company that you are going to use, you can gather all of the models you need for your starting company; detailed on the Battle Company's specific page. You should then write down all of the members of your company, including all of their wargear, on your roster sheet \u2014 a copy of this can be found on pages 126-127 and can be printed for your own personal use.</p> <p>It is a good idea to give each member of your company a name, that way it makes it much easier to record what each of them has accomplished. It also allows the members of your company to develop their own character and personality, and allows you to follow the stories that unfold as your company embarks on adventures and partakes in battles; celebrating their achievements and mourning their losses. Some people also paint the names of their company members on the bases of their models so they can easily identify them at a glance.</p> <p>Once you have chosen which Battle Company you are going to play, and gathered together all the various models you will need, the next thing to do is to select the Heroes of your company. When you start a Battle Company you will be able to select three of its members to become Heroes; they will each get a single point each of Might, Will and Fate, and will be treated as Hero models for all intents and purposes. Next, you will need to choose one of your Hero models to be the leader of your company; the other two become your leader's Sergeants. If, at any point during a Battle Companies campaign, your leader is slain, choose one of your Sergeants to be promoted to the leader of the Battle Company after the battle. If you ever have less than two Sergeants remaining, another Hero in your company, who is not already a leader or Sergeant, may become a Sergeant. Regardless of the number of Hero models in your Battle Company, you may only ever have a maximum of one leader and two Sergeants.</p> <p>It is also worth pointing out that the leader and Sergeants of your Battle Company are new Hero models, and as such are only able to use the universal Heroic Actions and not the specialised Heroic Actions \u2014 though they may gain access to some of these as they progress.</p> <p>Throughout your games and adventures in Middle-earth, your Battle Company will have a chance to recruit more members and swell in size. However, your Battle Company may not normally exceed a total of 15 models \u2014 though there are a few rare exceptions to this rule. Additionally, only 33% of the total members of your Battle Company can have bows unless otherwise stated. If your Battle Company cannot include any more models armed with bows, and a Reinforcement roll would provide your company with a model armed with a bow, choose a lower result on the same chart that suits your needs.</p> <p>Some models available to Battle Companies are classed as rare units; this means that a Battle Company can only ever have a certain number of them. When this is the case, it will be presented after the model's name in brackets stating Rare X, where X is the maximum number of that model available. For example, if a model has (Rare 1) after it, a Battle Company would only ever be allowed to have one of them. If a model has (Rare 2) after it, then a Battle Company could have a maximum of two, and so on. If your Battle Company cannot include any more Rare models, and a Reinforcement roll would provide your company with a Rare model, choose a lower result on the same chart that suits your needs.</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/mustering_your_warband/#step-2-play-a-game","title":"STEP 2 \u2014 PLAY A GAME","text":"<p>Once you have collected your Battle Company together, and given them all suitably Middle-earth sounding names, the next thing to do is find an opponent to play against \u2014 a rather vital thing when you are playing a game!

On pages 70-83 you will find a selection of 18 different Scenarios specially designed for Battle Companies for you to choose from. Some of these will be completely even for each side, with both trying to accomplish the same goals; whilst others will require one force to be the Attacker whilst the other force is the Defender.

Alternatively, if both sides agree that they will happily play any Scenario, you can roll-off to see which of the charts on page 71 to roll on to determine which one to play.</p> <p>During the game you will need to keep track of how many Wounds each model in your Battle Company inflicts upon the enemy, and which models have been removed from play as casualties.

This follows a similar principle to previous Battle Companies campaigns, so those of you that have played through other campaigns will have some idea as to how the campaign will work.</p> <p>This campaign is designed for you to take a starting Battle Company and embark on a narratively driven story, where your company will grow and improve as they face all manner of foes. In the Narrative Scenarios, your Battle Company will face a pre-determined force that will provide the essence of the campaign, and each one will be slightly harder than the last to ensure that your company is always challenged, even as they progress.</p> <p>The campaign has been written with Good Battle Companies in mind; however, this does not mean you cannot use an Evil Battle Company instead. Each Scenario will have a \"What if I'm using an Evil Battle Company?\" section at the end of it to account for this. For all of you out there who are champions of darkness, fear not! Keep an eye out for an Evil themed campaign in a future publication.</p> <p>Once you have gathered together your group of friends to play the campaign, and all chosen your respective Battle Companies (it works best if everyone has a different one), you can all begin the campaign. The first Scenario you will all need to play is Skirmish in Bree; this is designed to be played with a starting Battle Company and will provide the beginning of the story your Battle Companies will be taking part in.</p> <p>Each player should play this as their first game to give everyone the same opportunities to gather extra Equipment for their company. It is also a good idea to get another player to use the opposing force in each of the Narrative Scenarios, which will make the games far more interesting. The best way to go about this is for everyone to pair up with a partner and play two games; one player using the company whilst the other uses the opposing force, and then swapping over.</p> <p>After this we recommend playing at least one, but up to three, Battle Companies games between the members of your group before moving on to the second Narrative Scenario. As the Narrative Scenarios get progressively harder, this will allow you to progress the members of your company enough to successfully undertake each Scenario in turn \u2014 and as the Scenarios do get harder, this is rather sensible to do!

Weary from their travels, the company decides to pay a visit to the Prancing Pony in order to rest, restock their supplies, and enjoy good food and ale (all good stories begin in the pub, after all). The company are met with strange glances and muttering under breath; those within the tavern are unused to strangers in their lands and are suspicious of the group.</p> <p>Not wanting to draw too much attention, the company finds a quiet corner of the Pony to sit down in and begin to talk amongst themselves about their finds from their most recent outing. As the hours go by, the spirits of the company rise; the warmth of the fire and the plentiful spread contributing greatly. Soon the company is singing songs from their lands, and telling stories of their past adventures. Whilst many of the Breelanders ignore the company, the odd one or two listen intently, hanging on every word.</p> <p>Amid the raucous singing and tales of grandeur, the leader of your company is approached by an old man leaning heavily upon his walking stick. The man's face is mostly concealed by a long grey beard and faint blue hood that matched the robes he is clothed in. Though he appears frail, the man speaks with authority; his voice commanding great respect. He speaks to the company's leader at length, regaling stories and myths of a beast that roamed the lands near the northern-most peak of the Blue Mountains, and the treasure that lies within its lair, before leaving the company's leader to his own thoughts.</p> <p>With stories of treasure at the forefront of his mind, the company's leader gathers his companions, informing them of what he has just learned from the mysterious old man. The company engages in much discussion about the likelihood of this story being true, and if so, what they should do. In the end, they decide that if the treasure is even half of what the tales say, then it is simply too much to ignore and leave in the northern mountains. They decide to venture north and lay claim to the treasure for their masters, and the glories that go with it.</p> <p>Sending a message home to their lord, the company orders another round of ale, from a now very tired Barliman Butterbur, and begin laying the plans for their long journey to the very north of the Blue Mountains...</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/scenarios/","title":"Scenarios","text":"<p>Once you have gathered your force and found yourself an opponent, it is time to decide which of the Battle Company Scenarios you should play.

It often makes for a good game if both players use their Battle Company as part of a larger force from the same faction, that way it feels as if your company has joined their kinsmen upon the battlefield and that all of their adventures have been leading up to this one final defining moment.</p> <p>If you are playing an Open Play game, this is really simple. Just decide on what you want your game to be, and the forces that your companies are going to fight alongside and get going! Perhaps your company has to hold an area of the battlefield whilst their allies are trying to rescue them. Maybe your company has led a larger army to an enemy outpost and now they must join them as they try to capture it from their foes. Whatever story you come up with, Open Play lends itself perfectly to using your Battle Companies in larger games.</p> <p>You can also use your Battle Company in friendly Matched Play games with your friends. Simply work out the points value of your Battle Company, using the system outlined on page 9, and the company will cost that many points for a Matched Play game. Using your Battle Company in Matched Play games can throw up some interesting Scenarios for you to play. For example, perhaps you want to pit your company against a force of an equal points value and see how they fare. You could do this by finding an enemy Hero of a similar points cost to your leader and pit them against each other to see who would come out on top.</p> <p>When playing a Matched Play game using your Battle Company, there are a few additional things you should note as you play:</p> <ul> <li> <p>When deploying your Battle Company, treat the whole company as a single warband, with the company's leader as the captain of the warband. Ignore the other rules and restrictions for building a warband when doing this.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your Battle Company will count as being from the same army list as where their Hero and Warrior models are from for the purposes of Allies and whether the army will receive its Army Bonus. For example, a Minas Tirith Battle Company will count as being from the Minas Tirith army list, and a K\u00e2rna Battle Company will count as being from the Serpent Horde army list.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a Battle Company has models from more than one army list then the company will count as being from the army list that the leader of the company would normally be from. For example, a Men of the West Battle Company with a Warrior of Rohan as the leader would count as being from the Rohan army list; a Men of the West Battle Company with a Knight of Dol Amroth as the leader would count as being from the Fiefdoms army list.</p> </li> <li> <p>The leader of your Battle Company will always count as a Hero of Fortitude for the purposes of working out the leader of your overall army.</p> </li> <li> <p>Members of your Battle Company may still generate Experience Points in the same ways as described on page  7. </p> </li> <li> <p>Any members of your Battle Company that were removed as a casualty will still suffer Injuries, and therefore roll on the relevant Injury chart, as they would in normal Battle Companies games as described on page 10.</p> </li> <li> <p>Battle Companies are not designed to be used in tournament or competition play, only in friendly Matched Play games.</p> </li> </ul> <p>On the next page is an additional Matched Play Scenario that you can use if only one player is using a Battle Company, and on pages 116-117 is a Scenario that you can use if both players are using their Battle Companies in a game.</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/wars_aftermath/","title":"War's Aftermath","text":"<p>Following each game of Battle Companies, both sides will have a few things to work out.

They win the Duel roll and both score a Wound. As the Warrior of Minas Tirith only has 1 Wound, only one of the Wounds inflicted can count for the purposes of gaining Experience.

Each Battle Company has its own unique Reinforcement chart, which can be found on the Battle Company's own page. These will detail which models you can potentially recruit to your company, and what you need to roll to do so. It costs 3 Influence Points to roll on a Reinforcement chart, so make sure you spend them wisely!</p> <p>ADJUST A REINFORCEMENT ROLL</p> <p>The second way you can spend Influence Points is to adjust a roll you have made on a Reinforcement chart. This works in a similar way to using Might points to adjust the score on a D6, in that for each Influence Point spent in this way you may increase the result of your Reinforcement roll by 1. Note that unlike Might points, spent Influence Points do not carry over to a second roll should there be one. Only a maximum of 3 Influence Points can be spent in this manner per Reinforcement roll.</p> <p>PURCHASE ITEMS FROM THE ARMOURY</p> <p>The final way that you can spend Influence Points is to buy additional equipment and wargear for the Hero and Warrior models within your Battle Company.</p> <p>You may buy all manner of things for your Battle Company from the Armoury on pages 18-29, including wargear, Equipment, Wanderers and Creatures, for the cost given in Influence Points.</p> <p>Warrior models may only purchase wargear that is directly available to them; if you are unsure what your Warrior models may take, simply check their profile in the relevant Army book to find out what options they have.</p> <p>Hero models are much less limited by what wargear they may purchase, and may take any piece of wargear available to any member of their Battle Company.

This is a very important step as, when you play a game, the difference in Battle Company Ratings can have significant impacts on the outcome of that battle.</p> <p>Whilst at first it may seem tricky, working out your Battle Company Rating is easy, and won't take you very long following your battle \u2014 leaving even more time for another exciting encounter!</p> <p>WARRIORS</p> <p>Warrior models are simply worth the same amount in points as they are in their profile in the relevant Army book, including any wargear options they might possess.</p> <p>HEROES</p> <p>Hero models are a little more complicated to work out, but the process is still relatively simple.</p> <p>The first step you need to do is to work out the points cost of your Hero model, following the simple guide below:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Every Hero started out life in Battle Companies as a Warrior of some description, so start by noting down the cost of that Warrior using the system above.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each point of Might, Will or Fate that your Hero has gained, add 5 points.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each increase to the Hero model's Fight value (do not count any change in Shoot value), Strength, Defence or Courage characteristics, add 5 points.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each increase to the Hero model's Attacks or Wounds characteristics, add 10 points.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each special rule that the Hero has gained, add 5 points.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now that you have worked out the points cost of your Hero, you will need to work out the value of their wargear. The cost of the Hero model's wargear is dependent on the number of Attacks and Wounds the Hero has on their profile. If the number of Attacks and Wounds a Hero has adds up to a total of three or more, they will pay more for their wargear. In the Wargear section of the Armoury (page 18), every piece of wargear will be followed by a set of brackets containing two numbers separated by a slash \u2014 e.g., shield (1/5). The first number is the points cost of the piece of wargear if the Attacks and Wounds of the Hero total two or less, whilst the second number is the points cost of the piece of wargear if the Attacks and Wounds of the Hero total three or greater.</p> <p>Another important thing to note is that a Hero will not pay any points on any wargear that was built into their profile as a Warrior \u2014 that cost has already been taken into account.</p> <p>For example: A Hero who started life as a Warrior of Minas Tirith will not pay any points on their heavy armour as that came into account in the Warrior of Minas Tirith points cost, however, as a shield was bought as an option, the Hero would still pay the points cost for that as normal.</p> <p>Adelmar is Adam's Rohan Hero, and the leader of his Battle Company.

Additionally, a Khandish Chariot is an unusual model and moves in the following way:</p> <p>\u2022   At the start of its Move phase, the controlling player may pivot the Chariot up to 45\u00b0. When pivoting, the Chariot may touch models or terrain. In the case of models, move them out of the way by the shortest route possible. In the case of terrain, move the Chariot away just enough to complete its pivot.</p> <p>\u2022   The Chariot may then move up to 10\" in a straight line. After each full 3\" the Chariot has moved, it may pivot a further 45\u00b0.</p> <p>\u2022   Once the Chariot has pivoted to face its desired direction, move it forwards the desired amount in a straight line, ignoring enemy models' Control Zones. Any models the Chariot comes into contact with whilst moving (not pivoting) will suffer two Strength 4 hits. If the model is slain, the Chariot may continue with its movement. Cavalry models suffer two hits on both the rider and the mount. If the rider survives but the mount is slain, the rider is thrown and, after testing on the Thrown Rider chart, is placed in base contact with the Chariot. Might may not be used to affect the result of these hits. A Chariot that is affected by a Heroic March may still inflict these hits as normal.</p> <p>\u2022   If the model the Chariot charged survives, the Chariot will still gain the benefits of its Monstrous Charge special rule.</p> <p>\u2022   The Chariot may instead choose to forego its movement in order to pivot to face any direction. If a Chariot is moved by an enemy model, it may not pivot in this way.</p> <p>\u2022   A Khandish Chariot cannot jump obstacles that form a physical barrier, such as hedges, walls, fences or rocks. They may attempt to cross obstacles such as streams or gullies if they wish, but if a 1 is rolled, the rider is automatically thrown and the Chariot is destroyed. </p>"},{"location":"forces_of_good/","title":"Forces of Good","text":""},{"location":"forces_of_good/#good-armies-alliance-matrix","title":"GOOD ARMIES ALLIANCE MATRIX","text":"<p>ARMY KEY</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"forces_of_good/army_of_lake_town/","title":"Army of Lake-town","text":""},{"location":"forces_of_good/army_of_lake_town/#army-composition","title":"ARMY COMPOSITION","text":"<p>This army may include: Bard the Bowman; The Master of Laketown; Alfrid the Councilor; Braga, Captain of the Guard; Bain, Son of Bard; Sigrid &amp; Tilda; Lake-town Guard Captains and Lake-town Guard.</p> <p>The profile for Bard the Bowman can be found on page 49.

Any Chariot that has all of its crew slain is removed as a casualty.</p> <ul> <li>Rapid Fire Bolt Thrower (ACTIVE)</li> </ul> <p>Any Iron Hills Dwarf, that is not the driver, may man the rapid fire bolt thrower. This is a crossbow that fires D6 shots per turn. The bolt thrower only has a limited field of fire of 45\u02da to its left or right. The Chariot may still fire even if it has moved its full distance that turn. Additionally, the Chariot does not suffer the -1 penalty for moving and shooting.</p> <p>The Chariot may still shoot even if Engaged in combat and does not need an In The Way test for models Engaged with it. Each shot may target a different enemy. If it does this, then the Dwarf operating the rapid fire bolt thrower may not add its Attacks or Fight value to the Duel roll, and may not make Strikes, in the following Fight phase.</p> <ul> <li>Chariot Charge (ACTIVE)</li> </ul> <p>The Iron Hills Chariot is an unusual model and moves in the following way:</p> <p>\u2022 At the start of the Move phase, the controlling player may pivot the Chariot up to 45\u00ba. When pivoting, the Chariot may touch models or terrain. In the case of models, move them out of the way by the shortest route possible. In the case of terrain, move the Chariot away just enough to complete its pivot.</p> <p>\u2022 The Chariot may then move up to 4\" in a straight line.</p> <p>\u2022 If it has moved a full 4\", it may pivot a further 45\u00ba.</p> <p>\u2022 The Chariot may then move up to a further 4\" in a straight line.</p> <p>\u2022 When the Chariot moves, it ignores enemy models' Control Zones. Any models the Chariot comes into contact with whilst moving (not pivoting) will suffer three Strength 6 hits. If the model is slain then the Chariot may continue with its movement. Cavalry models suffer three hits on both the rider and the mount. If the rider survives but the mount is slain, the rider is thrown and, after testing on the Thrown Rider chart, is placed in base contact with the Chariot. Might may not be used to affect the result of these hits. A Chariot that is affected by a Heroic March may still inflict these hits as normal.</p> <p>\u2022 If the model the Chariot Charged survives, the Chariot will still gain the benefits of its Monstrous Charge special rule.</p> <p>\u2022 The Chariot may instead choose to forego its movement in order to pivot to face any direction. If a Chariot is moved by an enemy model, it may not pivot in this way.</p> <ul> <li>The Chariot in Combat (ACTIVE)</li> </ul> <p>The Chariot counts as one model in a fight. Any surviving crew member that is not driving the Chariot adds their Attacks to the Duel roll. Additionally, the Chariot will also use the highest Fight value of any Dwarf that is on the Chariot (including the driver). No model that is riding on an Iron Hills Chariot can declare a Heroic Combat.</p> <p>If beaten, any model wishing to Strike the crew must roll to see if they hit the crew or the Chariot. To do this, roll a D6 for each Strike. On a 4+, the Strike hits the crew member of the attacker's choice \u2013 anything else hits the Chariot.</p> <p>If the Chariot loses the Fight, it does not Back Away. It also never counts as Trapped. If the Chariot is slain, then the crew inside are lost \u2013 remove the model as a casualty.</p> <ul> <li>Large War Machine (ACTIVE)</li> </ul> <p>On a turn in which the Iron Hills Chariot Charges, it gains the Extra Attack and Knock to the Ground bonuses as if it was a Cavalry model. The Iron Hills Chariot still gets these bonuses even if it charges a Cavalry model. When the Chariot is hit by a shooting attack, the shooter must take an In The Way test to determine if the Chariot or the crew are hit. On a 1-4, the Chariot has been hit and on a 5-6, it hits the Dwarf closest to the shooter. The Chariot may not make Jump, Climb, Leap or Swim tests, and may not lie down or defend barriers. It may not enter difficult terrain other than shallow water features (including swamps, rivers, etc.), which it is completely unimpeded by. The Chariot cannot be Barged, Hurled or knocked Prone for any reason.</p> <ul> <li>The Chariot and Magic (ACTIVE)</li> </ul> <p>Models with Magical Powers can use them on the Chariot, selecting either the Chariot itself or one of the crew members as the target. Magical Powers that affect multiple targets will automatically affect both the Chariot and its crew, if in range of the model. Only by affecting the Driver will a Magical Power such as Transfix or Compel impede the Chariot's movement (thereby causing it to remain stationary or take a move as described by the Magical Power). Finally, Magical Powers such as Sorcerous Blast, Nature's Wrath and Call Winds will not move the Chariot or knock it Prone, although they will still inflict any damage as detailed in the Magical Power's description.</p> <ul> <li>Iron Hills Captain (ACTIVE)</li> </ul> <p>If this upgrade is taken for the Chariot, then an Iron Hills Captain will replace the driver. The Iron Hills Captain will have all of the usual wargear and special rules that an Iron Hills Captain would normally possess whilst riding the Chariot (see page 29). The Chariot counts as a Hero for the Iron Hills army list and may be the army leader. If the Iron Hills Captain is taken, replace the Warrior keyword with Hero whilst the Captain remains alive.</p>"},{"location":"forces_of_good/the_iron_hills/#champions-of-erebor-as-crew-designers-note","title":"CHAMPIONS OF EREBOR AS CREW: DESIGNER'S NOTE","text":"<ul> <li>Champions of Erebor (ACTIVE)</li> </ul> <p>If this upgrade is taken for the Chariot, then instead of being crewed by four Iron Hills Dwarves, it is crewed by Balin the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; Dwalin the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; Kili the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor and Fili the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor. If the Champions of Erebor are taken, replace the Warrior keyword with Hero.</p> <p>The Chariot is also subject to the following exceptions:</p> <p>\u2022 Balin must always be the driver. Should Balin the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor be slain, another Dwarf on the Chariot immediately takes his place. Should all the Dwarves be slain, then the Chariot is removed as a casualty. If the Chariot is slain, the Dwarves take a Thrown Rider test instead.</p> <p>\u2022 The Dwarves who ride the Chariot have all of their usual wargear and special rules (see pages 38-39) whilst riding in the Chariot.</p> <p>\u2022 Dwalin must always man the rapid fire bolt thrower until he is slain.</p> <p>\u2022 Unlike other Iron Hills Chariots, only Balin, Dwalin, Kili and Fili may ride this Chariot.</p> <p>\u2022 Magical Powers may be directed at the Dwarves individually, in which case they will Resist and be affected individually with no impact on each other.</p> <p>\u2022 In combat, the Chariot is very unusual in that a Duel can effectively have multiple models on both sides of the Fight. When making a Duel roll, make sure to roll each Dwarf's attacks separately for the purpose of using Might points. Additionally, each Dwarf may decide to use Special Strikes. If Kili or Fili use the Feint Special Strike, then the Fight values of all of the crew and the Chariot itself will be reduced by D3. If Kili or Fili use the Stab Special Strike, then only they will be affected. If Dwalin uses the Piercing Strike Special Strike then only his Strength and Defence will be affected.</p> <p>\u2022 This version of the Chariot counts as four models for the purpose of working out Break points.</p> <p>\u2022 The Chariot counts as a Hero for the Erebor Reclaimed army list and may be the army leader.

To allow for this, Tournament Organisers may choose to use Major and Minor victories to further separate the players in the rankings.</p> <p>If a player achieves double or more Victory Points than their opponent, they will achieve a Major Victory while their opponent will receive a Major Loss. If a player wins their game, but doesn't score double or more Victory Points than their opponent, they will earn a Minor Victory whilst their opponent will receive a Minor Loss.</p> <p>For example: In a tournament, Jay beats Rob by 9 Victory Points to 4. As Jay has scored at least double the number of Victory Points as Rob, Jay achieves a Major Victory whilst Rob receives a Major Loss.</p> <p>On the next table, Sam beats Adam by 3 Victory Points to 2, and so Sam wins a Minor Victory, giving Adam a Minor Loss.</p> <p>If a tournament uses this system, then it should change the Tournament Points scored as provided on page 5 to the following:</p> <p>Major Victory: 6 Tournament Points</p> <p>Minor Victory: 5 Tournament Points</p> <p>Draw: 2 Tournament Points</p> <p>Minor Loss: 1 Tournament Point</p> <p>Major Loss: 0 Tournament Points</p>"},{"location":"matched_play_guide/additional_rules/#switching-tiebreakers","title":"SWITCHING TIEBREAKERS","text":"<p>If a Tournament Organiser wishes, they may choose to change the order of the tiebreakers listed on page 5 to better suit the theme of their event.

In a more competitive Matched Play environment, Tournament Organisers will often stick to the main tiebreakers laid out on page 5, maybe with others added afterwards if needed.

On the second day they play the first two games at 750 points, before playing the final game at 1,000 points.</p> <p>There are a couple of things that are important to remember when running these Escalation style events. Firstly, at the start of the event players will need to submit all of their army lists for all of the points levels they will be playing.

These are a selection of additional missions that players can choose from at the start of a round, and will try to achieve during their game without revealing them to their opponent. Often, events that use these Secret Objectives will use them as the first tiebreaker; so they are rather important when in use!</p> <p>There are a total of 12 different Secret Objectives that can be used (provided over the following pages). At the start of the game, each player should select three of the Secret Objectives to put forward without making them known to their opponent. Their opponent will then roll a D3 to determine which of the three will then be used during the game. Once a Secret Objective has been selected to be used in a game, then it cannot be put forward again for the remainder of the event. Players should write down the Secret Objective they are trying to achieve on a piece of paper and place it at the edge of the board. They should also submit which Secret Objective they've used, and whether they were successful in achieving it, to the Tournament Organiser at the end of the game.</p> <p>It is important to note that not all Secret Objectives will always be achievable in every game. For example, if your opponent has no Monster models in their army, then you won't be able to score the Bring them Down! Secret Objective as there will be no Monster models to kill.</p> <p>1. BRING THEM DOWN!</p> <p>Kill all Monster models in your opponent's army by the end of the game. Monster models that flee the board count towards scoring this Secret Objective.</p> <p>2.

The second number is called the Shoot value and is always followed by the + sign; this shows the model's skill with missile weapons. The number indicates what score needs to be rolled in order for the model to hit its intended target; so in this instance, the lower it is, the better.</p> <p>S (Strength) - This characteristic shows how strong the model is. The higher a model's Strength, the more easily it will injure an opponent.</p> <p>D (Defence) - Defence represents how hard it is to hurt a model. The higher it is, the harder the model is to wound in battle.</p> <p>A (Attacks) - The Attacks characteristic represents how many blows a model can land upon an enemy during a Duel. It literally translates to the number of dice that a model will roll during the Fight phase, both for making the initial Duel roll, and for making Strikes against an enemy.</p> <p>W (Wounds) - This denotes how many injuries a model can sustain before it will succumb to its wounds and be slain. If at any point during the game a model's Wounds are reduced to 0, they are immediately removed from the board as a casualty.</p> <p>C (Courage) - The bravery and determination of a model is measured by their Courage characteristic.</p> <p>M, W, F (Might, Will, Fate) - Some models, known as Hero models, possess an additional three characteristics known as Might, Will and Fate.

Throughout a game, you'll often find yourself referring to these to see which model wins a Duel, or whether a weapon's blow wounds a victim, etc.</p> <p>Mv (Move) \u2014 This characteristic is probably used the most in the game \u2014 it tells you how far in inches (\") that model may move in each of its Move phases.</p> <p>F (Fight) \u2014 Fight is the characteristic that denotes a model's skill at fighting a Duel and firing a shooting weapon. This characteristic comprises two numbers divided by a slash. The first number is called the Fight value and shows how skilful the model is in a Duel; the better they are, the higher the Fight value. The second number is called the Shoot value and is always followed by the + sign; this shows the model's skill with missile weapons. The number indicates what score needs to be rolled in order for the model to hit its intended target; so in this instance, the lower it is, the better.</p> <p>S (Strength) \u2014 This characteristic shows how strong the model is. A mighty Troll will have a much higher Strength than a lowly Hobbit, for example. The higher a model's Strength, the more easily it will injure an opponent.</p> <p>D (Defence) \u2014 Defence represents how hard it is to hurt a model. If a model is clad in thick armour, or is inherently tough and resilient, its Defence will be higher, and the higher it is, the harder the model is to wound in battle.</p> <p>A (Attacks) \u2014 The Attacks characteristic represents how many blows a model can land upon an enemy during a Duel. It literally translates to the number of dice that a model will roll during the Fight phase, both for making the initial Duel roll, and for making Strikes against an enemy.</p> <p>W (Wounds) \u2014 This denotes how many injuries a model can sustain before it will succumb to its wounds and be slain. If at any point during the game a model's Wounds are reduced to 0, they are immediately removed from the board as a casualty. Most fighters will have just a single Wound, so will be removed as soon as they are wounded. Some creatures and characters are possessed with an exceptional resolve or massive bulk and can suffer two, three or even more Wounds before they are slain.</p> <p>C (Courage) \u2014 How brave and determined a model is is measured by their Courage characteristic. The lower this value, the more likely the model is to quail in fear from a terrifying foe or flee the battlefield when the going gets tough.</p> <p>M, W, F (Might, Will, Fate) \u2014 Some models, known as Hero models, possess an additional three characteristics known as Might, Will and Fate. Unlike the other characteristics, these are represented by a store of points that can be spent during the game.</p> <p>A Hero can use these points to perform special actions throughout the course of the game, avoid harm or any number of other heroic feats.

A small game will usually take no longer than an hour, sometimes even shorter, to finish \u2014 perfect for a quick lunchtime clash or if you are tight on time.</p> <p>A Battle will typically be around the 600-1,000 point mark, but this will often vary depending upon the amount of time available. A Battle will allow players to field an average of three or four warbands, although some armies may get more or less depending on what they put in their force. A Battle also allows you to field some of your much bigger models that you may not be able to field at Skirmish level. Battles will usually take somewhere between one and a half to two and a half hours to play, making them ideal for tournaments, gaming weekends or just a casual afternoon with some friends.</p> <p>All-out War games are the biggest scale games that you can play, starting around the 1,250 point mark and going upwards from there, making for a truly epic confrontation. An All-out War will allow most players to achieve at least six warbands each, even if they take lots of big monsters and legendary heroes along with them, allowing for players to field a mighty army with everything they will want to field! An All-out War game can take a long time \u2014 many will last for the whole day and for the biggest, maybe even an entire weekend.

Filled with wrath at the coming of the usurper, Thorin Oakenshield, Smaug gives chase to Bilbo and the Dwarves of Erebor, during which he will nearly perish under a lake of liquid gold brought about by Thorin's Company.</p> <p>Filled with rage from his encounter with the Dwarves in Erebor and their attempt on his life, Smaug promises revenge upon the fishermen of Lake- town for the aid they provided to Thorin.</p> <p>His wrath rains down upon Esgaroth like a murderous storm, setting huge swathes of the settlement alight with tremendous strafing runs and gouts of flame. The only hope for the people of Lake-town is for the Dragon to be slain, an act much easier said than done.</p> <p>Yet all is not lost. Having escaped imprisonment at the hands of the Master of Lake-town, Bard grabs his great bow and sets out to finish what his ancestor Girion started many years before, lest Lake-town be razed to the ground and be consumed by fire and smoke \u2014 the mark left upon the Dragon by the Lord of Dale may yet prove to be Smaug's undoing. </p> <p>LAYOUT</p> <p>This Scenario is played across the wooden jetties and walkways of Esgaroth.

The ruins are that of the ancient city of Ann\u00faminas, an ancient seat of power in Arnor before it fell into ruin and the kings moved to Fornost.</p> <p>Though they have long since crumbled and faded, small hints of the former grandeur and extravagance of the halls that once stood here still lingers on, and the company stand in awe within the city's broken walls. However, the company soon realises that they are not alone within the ruins of Ann\u00faminas; the sound of metal scratching on stone and the unmistakable Orcish howls can be heard, and from deeper within the ruins a faint, eerie glow can be seen.</p> <p>Weary from their travels, the company is in desperate need of a place to rest, but they must clear the ruins of the Orcs or they will be cut to pieces as they sleep.

Having narrowed down its location, the two armies now fight for possession of this relic. However, the powers that linger upon this mysterious object are easily capable of corrupting those who hold it for too long.</p> <p>SCENARIO OUTLINE</p> <p>A precious relic lies upon the battlefield. They who hold it will win the day!</p> <p>THE ARMIES</p> <p>Players choose their forces, as described on page 130 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual, to an equal points value before the game.</p> <p>LAYOUT</p> <p>Set up terrain as described on page 136 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual. Then, place six Objective markers on the battlefield. To place the Objectives, both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score places one Objective marker anywhere on the battlefield at least 6\" away from any board edge. Their opponent then places an Objective at least 12\" away from the existing Objective marker and 6\" away from any board edge. The players then alternate placing the remaining Objectives, according to the restriction noted earlier.</p> <p>STARTING POSITIONS</p> <p>At the battle's start, the forces are yet to arrive \u2014 models are not deployed at the start of the game, but will enter as the game continues (see Special Rules on page 21).</p> <p>INITIAL PRIORITY</p> <p>Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.</p> <p>OBJECTIVES</p> <p>The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to a quarter (25%) of its starting number of models, or below, at which point, the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.</p> <p>SCORING VICTORY POINTS</p> <ul> <li> <p>You score 6 Victory Points if your force is in possession of the relic at the end of the game. If at the end of the game you are not in possession of the relic but have more models within 3\" of the relic than your opponent, then you instead score 3 Victory Points.</p> </li> <li> <p>You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader. Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count. If you kill the enemy leader, you instead score 2 Victory Points.</p> </li> <li> <p>You score 1 Victory Point if the enemy force is Broken at the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken and your force is unbroken, you instead score 2 Victory Points.</p> </li> <li> <p>You score 1 Victory Point if you have at least one banner remaining at the end of the game. If you have at least one banner remaining and your opponent has none remaining, then you instead score 2 Victory Points. </p> </li> </ul> <p>SPECIAL RULES</p> <p>Uncovering the Relic: Only one of the Objective markers is actually the relic that both sides seek. The first time each turn an unengaged Infantry model ends its movement in base contact with an Objective, they may search it in an attempt to uncover the relic. When this happens roll a D6. On a 6, the relic has been discovered and the model that discovered it takes possession of it (Might cannot be used to influence this roll). If the roll is a 1-5 then the relic is not there, remove the Objective from play. If the first five Objective markers to be searched do not reveal the relic, the last one will automatically be the relic, there is no need to roll for it.</p> <p>Relic of Power: The relic is treated as a Light Object (see page 109 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual). However the dark powers that lie upon it may seep into the mind of its holder. Unwilling to give it up, models carrying the relic may not drop it or pass it to another model. Additionally, at the start of each turn, before Priority is rolled, roll a D6. On a 1, the model is Transfixed as on page 98 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual. Might may not be used to modify this roll.</p> <p>Maelstrom of Battle: At the end of your Move phase, roll a D6 for each of your warbands not on the battlefield and consult the chart opposite (the warband's captain can use Might to alter the roll either up or down). Models can't Charge in the turn that they arrive but otherwise act normally. Roll for each warband separately, deploy the models in the warband, then roll for the next.
